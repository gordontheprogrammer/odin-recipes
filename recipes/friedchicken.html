    <h3>How To Make it:</h3>
    <p>To make mouthwatering fried chicken,
        start by marinating the chicken pieces in a buttermilk mixture
        for a few hours or overnight. In a separate bowl, combine all-purpose flour with a blend of spices like paprika, garlic powder,
        onion powder, salt, and pepper. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk and dredge each piece in the seasoned flour,
        ensuring they are well coated. Heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or Dutch oven to about 350°F (175°C).
        Carefully place the chicken pieces into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.
        Fry them until golden brown and cooked through, typically taking about 15-20 minutes.
        Transfer the fried chicken to a wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil.
        Serve hot and enjoy the crispy, juicy goodness of homemade fried chicken.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken pieces (such as drumsticks, thighs, or bone-in breast)</li>
        <li>Buttermilk (enough to fully submerge the chicken)</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour (approximately 2 cups)</li>
        <li>Paprika (1 tablespoon)</li>
        <li>Garlic powder (1 teaspoon)</li>
        <li>Onion powder (1 teaspoon)</li>
        <li>Salt (1 teaspoon)</li>
        <li>Black pepper (1/2 teaspoon)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the chicken: Place the chicken pieces in a bowl and cover them with buttermilk.
            Ensure that the chicken is fully submerged. Let it marinate for a few hours or overnight in the refrigerator.
            This helps to tenderize the chicken and infuse it with flavor.
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the seasoned flour: In a separate bowl, mix the all-purpose flour with paprika,
            garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper.
            Combine the ingredients well to ensure even distribution of the spices.
        </li>
        <li>Dredge the chicken: Remove the chicken pieces from the buttermilk,
            allowing any excess to drip off. Dip each piece into the seasoned flour,
            pressing it firmly to adhere the flour mixture to the chicken.
            Make sure the chicken is evenly coated on all sides.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oil: In a deep frying pan or Dutch oven,
            heat vegetable oil to a temperature of around 350°F (175°C).
            Use enough oil to fully submerge the chicken pieces.
        </li>
        <li>Fry the chicken: Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil,
            making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry them in batches, if necessary.
            Cook the chicken until it turns golden brown and reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C),
            which ensures it is fully cooked. This usually takes about 15-20 minutes,
            depending on the size and thickness of the chicken pieces.
        </li>
        <li>Drain excess oil: Once the chicken is cooked,
            transfer it to a wire rack or paper towels to drain any excess oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve and enjoy: Serve the hot and crispy fried chicken immediately.
            It pairs well with side dishes like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or cornbread.
