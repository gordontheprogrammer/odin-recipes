    <h3>How To Make it:</h3>
    <p>
        Carbonara pasta is a classic Italian dish known for its rich and creamy sauce. To make carbonara pasta, start by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. While the water is boiling, heat a skillet over medium heat and cook diced bacon until crispy. Remove the bacon from the skillet and set it aside, leaving the rendered bacon fat in the pan.
        In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and black pepper until well combined. Set this mixture aside. Once the water is boiling, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente, usually around 8-10 minutes. Before draining the pasta, reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta water.
        Next, add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the rendered bacon fat and toss to coat the pasta. Remove the skillet from the heat and slowly pour in the egg and cheese mixture while continuously tossing the pasta to evenly distribute the sauce. The residual heat from the pasta will gently cook the eggs, creating a creamy and velvety texture.
        If the sauce seems too thick, gradually add the reserved pasta water, a little at a time, until desired consistency is reached. Be careful not to add too much water, as the sauce should cling to the pasta. Finally, sprinkle the crispy bacon over the pasta and give it a final toss.
        To serve, plate the carbonara pasta and garnish with additional grated Parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepper. The result is a comforting and indulgent dish with creamy, flavorful sauce coating each strand of pasta. Carbonara pasta is best enjoyed immediately while it's still warm, so dig in and savor the delightful combination of flavors and textures.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces (225 grams) of spaghetti or any pasta of your choice</li>
        <li>4-6 slices of bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for garnish</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus extra for garnish</li>
        <li>Salt, for seasoning the pasta water</li>
        <li>Optional: 1/2 cup reserved pasta water (to adjust sauce consistency)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
            Add the spaghetti or pasta of your choice and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.
            This usually takes around 8-10 minutes.
            Before draining the pasta, reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta water.
        </li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking,
            heat a skillet over medium heat.
            Add the diced bacon to the skillet and cook until crispy and browned.
            Once cooked, remove the bacon from the skillet and set it aside on a paper towel-lined plate.
            Leave the rendered bacon fat in the pan.
        </li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs,
            grated Parmesan cheese, and black pepper until well combined.
            Set this mixture aside.
        </li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked and drained,
            add it to the skillet with the rendered bacon fat.
            Toss the pasta in the skillet to evenly coat it with the bacon fat.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from the heat and slowly pour in the egg and cheese
            mixture while continuously tossing the pasta.
            The residual heat from the pasta will gently cook the eggs,
            creating a creamy sauce. Make sure to keep tossing the pasta to
            prevent the eggs from scrambling.
        </li>
        <li>If the sauce seems too thick,
            gradually add the reserved pasta water,
            a little at a time, while continuing to toss the pasta.
            This will help adjust the consistency of the sauce.
            Be careful not to add too much water,
            as the sauce should cling to the pasta.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle the crispy bacon over the pasta and give it a
            final toss to combine all the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Plate the carbonara pasta and garnish with additional
            grated Parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve the carbonara pasta immediately while it's still warm.
            The creamy sauce, savory bacon, and flavorful cheese will make
            for a delicious and satisfying dish.
